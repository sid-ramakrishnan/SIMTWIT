@lukkha @arpiit latest trick is to get customers to pay $99 for prime, and then charge tehm higher prices anyway :)
@arpiit technically yes. Lot of complications enforcing it tho. @lukkha

@lukkha @arpiit You were shown higher price if logged in, but lower price if not. Dumb thing because customers discovered it.
@lukkha @arpiit Well, no. Amazon tried stunts once - even legal - by offering lower discounts to logged in customers. Blew up in their face

#ShameOnTimesNow For the boorish shouting before this day. For promoting the shrill and superficial and agenda driven. NeverEverNeverEver?
#ShameOnTimesNow is not because of this stupidity. It's because someday they just took it too far. Like Shiv Sena criticising TEndulkar.
Today #ShameOnTimesNow trends because they called the Indian team performance a "disgrace" and hosted a show around it?

@Knmurjani It's crazy, lots of option writing. This is not going to end well.
